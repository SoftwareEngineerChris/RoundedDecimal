Swift decimals where the number of decimal places is explicitly part of the type

## Why

**_TL/DR: We would like to guarantee a level of precision, or be explicit when changing the level of precision, of decimals moving through our system._**

When dealing with decimals we often want to know; deal with; or maintain a number of decimal places in the number we're representing. 

For example when dealing with money ðŸ’µ in the simple world, for example in a shopping application, we often want to deal with numbers that have **2 decimal places**. Especially when dealing with lots of these numbers.

If we have a product that costs **$2.50** to sell in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, and we wanted to sell it in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, we may want to use an exchange rate to calculate the local price. If the rate provided by our API is **0.81245 USD per GBP** (or **1.23084 GBP per USD**), using a simple multiplication, we may calculate the price for the item to be **Â£3.0771**.

We probably don't want to present **Â£3.0771** to our user as they don't normally deal in fractions of pennies. In our presentation layer we may format the value in the receipt as **Â£3.08**. The user has decided to order **300** of these items. The calculation part of our application doesn't necessarily know how the data is being presented, so deals with the item price of **Â£3.0771**. Therefore, **Â£3.0771** multiplied by **300** is **Â£923.13**.

In this case we may present a receipt ðŸ§¾ to the user which looks like: `Special Product @ Â£3.08 x 300 = Â£923.13`

Except **300** multiplied by **Â£3.08** _isn't_ **Â£923.13**. It's **Â£924.00**. Our user is confused about the total we're presenting to them, not realising that our calculation used a price of Â£3.0771 per item rather than the Â£3.08 presented to them. Not only that, but we're sending the presented item price to our analytics system - and its not aligning with the totals in our sales system. What a nightmare ðŸ¤¯.

What they should have seen on their receipt is either:
`Special Product @ Â£3.08 x 300 = Â£924.00` or  `Special Product @ Â£3.0771 x 300 = Â£923.13`

Of course, how this is handled should be a business decision ðŸ“ˆ, but we should be able to guarantee the decision in our code. If we can leverage the type system to help us out, we can make this a compile-time requirement. `RoundedDecimal` can help us with that.
